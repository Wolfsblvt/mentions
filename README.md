mentions (3.2)
========

Ported to PhpBB3.2 the great Wolfsblvt extension (https://github.com/Wolfsblvt/mentions)

Allows users to mention other users in posts. If a user is mentioned, he will recieve a notification unless he deactivated this notification. Meantioned usernames can be automatically colored in their username color. Mentioned users will be autosuggested.
